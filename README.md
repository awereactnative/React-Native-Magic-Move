## Usage

Installation

```
$ yarn add react-native-magic-move
```

Link the native extensions *(\* recommended but not required)*

```
$ react-native link react-native-magic-move 
```  

\* *For the optimal performance, the native extensions are advised but not necessary. With [expo](expo.io) or [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), "react-native-magic-move" may now be used. Please refer to [this manual](https://github.com/awereactnative/React-Native-Magic-Move/blob/main/NativeInstallation.md) for instructions on how to manually install the native extensions if you are experiencing difficulty with the installation.*

Wrap your app with the <`MagicMove.Provider`> context.

```jsx
import * as MagicMove from 'react-native-magic-move';

const App = () => (
  <MagicMove.Provider>
    {...}
  </MagicMove.Provider>
);
```

Add the <`MagicMove.{View|Image|Text}`> component to your views. Whenever the Magic Move component is mounted while another Magic Move component with the same `id` is already mounted, then a magic transition between the components is performed.


```jsx
import * as MagicMove from 'react-native-magic-move';

const Scene1 = () => (
  <MagicMove.Scene>
    <MagicMove.View id="logo" style={{
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        backgroundColor: "green",
        borderRadius: 50
      }} />
  </MagicMove.Scene>
);

const Scene2 = () => (
  <MagicMove.Scene>
    <MagicMove.View id="logo" style={{
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        backgroundColor: "purple",
        borderRadius: 0
      }} />
  </MagicMove.Scene>
);
```

## react-navigation

When you are using [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (or [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux)), then also install the following binding:

- [react-navigation-magic-move](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-navigation-magic-move)

## Documentation

### Components

The following magic-move components are supported out of the box.

- `MagicMove.View`
- `MagicMove.Text`
- `MagicMove.Image`

You can also create your own custom MagicMove components.

```js
const MyMagicMoveComponent = MagicMove.createMagicMoveComponent(MyComponent);

// When creating a custom image component (e.g. FastImage) also specify the `image` attribute
// so that the `move` transition treats this as an image.
const MagicMoveFastImage = MagicMove.createMagicMoveComponent(FastImage, {ComponentType: 'image'});

// Full signature
/* MagicMove.createMagicMoveComponent(Component, {
  AnimatedComponent,
  ComponentType,
  ...props
});*/
```

### Transitions

The following transition functions are available out of the box.

| Transition                                | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MagicMove.Transition.move` **(default)** | Moves the component while adjusting for border-radii and size. Takes the image `resizeMode` into account to create a seamless image transition without any stretching. |
| `MagicMove.Transition.morph`              | Morphs the shape, size and colours  of the target to look like the source                                                                                              |
| `MagicMove.Transition.dissolve`           | Cross fade the source into the target                                                                                                                                  |
| `MagicMove.Transition.flip`               | Flip the source to reveal the target on the backside (auto choose axis)                                                                                                |
| `MagicMove.Transition.flip.x`             | Flip the source to reveal the target on the backside (over x-axis)                                                                                                     |
| `MagicMove.Transition.flip.y`             | Flip the source to reveal the target on the backside (over y-axis)                                                                                                     |
| `MagicMove.Transition.flip.xy`            | Flip the source to reveal the target on the backside (over x- and y-axes)                                                                                              |
| `MagicMove.Transition.shrinkAndGrow`      | Shrink and let the source disappear while letting the target appear and grow                                                                                           |
| `MagicMove.Transition.squashAndStretch`   | Scale the target to the size of the source and squash and stretch to give it the illusion of momentum and mass                                                         |

You can also create your own transition functions, see [`src/transitions`](https://github.com/awereactnative/React-Native-Magic-Move/tree/main/transitions) for examples.

### Scenes

Use <`MagicMove.Scene`> to mark the start of a scene within the rendering hierarchy.
This is important so that Magic Move can correctly assess the destination-position of an animation.
`MagicMove.Scene` is implemented using a regular `View` and supports all its properties.

| Property          | Type       | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled`        | `bool`     | `false` | Disable transitions to this scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `active`          | `bool`     |         | This special prop is intended for integrating magic-move with 3rd party navigators such as `react-navigation`. *Do not use it unless you know what you are doing.* By setting it to `true` or `false` the navigation package can control which scene is active and which is no longer active. |
| `debug`           | `boolean`  | `false` | Enables debug-mode to analyze animations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `onWillAppear`    | `function` |         | Callback that is called when the scene is about to appear                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `onWillDisappear` | `function` |         | Callback that is called when the scene is about to disappear                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Context

When a magic-move is performend, a temporary clone of the source and/or target component is rendered onto the screen. Now imagine you have some animations that run when your component is mounted (e.g. `Animatable.View`), that would also mean these animations are run on the cloned component. This is probably not what you want and you might want to hide those components entirely in the cloned component. To do so you can use the <`MagicMove.Context`> API. It allows you to detect whether the component is rendered as a clone and whether it is the source or target of a magic move animation.


**Example**

```jsx
<MagicMove.View>
  <MagicMove.Context>
    {({isClone, isTarget}) => (
      <Animatable.View animation={isClone ? undefined : 'zoomIn'} />
    )}
  </MagicMove.Context>
</MagicMove.View>
```

## Disclaimer 
Magic-move gives the appearance that elements are changing or morphing from one scene to another. But it doesn't truly transfer elements to different scenes. There will be times when the illusion won't work for you, just like with actual magic tricks. And much as with magic tricks, you might need to **"set the scene"** (such as changing certain things in your app) in order to produce the desired transition. Now that you've been given a reality check, go ahead and conjure up some slick illusions.
